//     Define what you want the component to have.
//     The state is the data that this component will have when it is first rendered/loaded. State can change. 
//     state = {};
   
//     Define how you want it to look and what you want it to do.
//     Renders the state you can to see

// React users a virtual DOM. Like when you send out a request, the browser gives back a response (Java, HTML, CSS // JSX), browser builds DOM and then renders it. 
// React keeps a copy of the browser DOM in memory so that it's much quicker. Recognises a state change, computes the difference, and re-renders.
